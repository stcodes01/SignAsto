# HandDetection using ML/DL
Developed a machine learning project utilizing landmark detection algorithms and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image processing and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Implemented with Python, leveraging OpenCV for computer vision tasks and cvzone for streamlined development.
Created a sign language recognition system that detects hand signs and displays the corresponding alphabet using PyCharm
